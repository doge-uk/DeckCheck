**DeckCheck** is a desktop application that scans audio files and verifies compatibility with Pioneer CDJ and XDJ players. It helps DJs ensure their USB drives contain properly formatted audio files before heading to the club or gig.

## Features

- **Multi-Device Support** - Check compatibility against multiple CDJ/XDJ models simultaneously
- **Comprehensive Format Analysis** - Detects bit depth, sample rate, bitrate, and encoding
- **Visual Feedback** - Color-coded results (pass/warn/blocked) for quick assessment
- **Filtering** - Filter files by pass/fail status
- **Search** - Quick file search within scanned results
- **Detailed Reports** - View per-device compatibility issues with specific failure reasons
- **Modern Interface** - Clean, dark-themed UI with responsive design

## Usage

Launch DeckCheck and pick your scan method from the toolbar:

- **Scan Folder** - Check a single folder of audio files. Quick and simple.

- **Parse XML** - Load a rekordbox collection export. Ideal if your library spans multiple folders.
    Export it first: rekordbox → File → Export Collection in XML format.
## Supported Devices

- CDJ-3000X
- CDJ-3000
- CDJ-2000NXS2
- XDJ-1000MK2
